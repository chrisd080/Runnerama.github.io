		<h1>Background</h1>
		<p>This project is about creating awareness around contemporary fitness trends relating to everyday routines which involve people either 
							running/walking to, in and around various areas of the environment (in wellington). This has a massive effect on our energy levels as it can 
							either consume a lot or less depending on how we implement this. Do we ever consider this or are our focuses only on the destination and 
							how to get there? <br>
						My initial idea behind creating this project was as i am a runner and i experience the thought sometimes especially when i feel tired some days
					even though im running on the same directions and distance. This lead me to think that my energy must be expended in different ways on those specific runs 
				and i thought to myself how cool it would be to have something that tell you how to conserve your energy to conistenly run for longer and feel less tired
			and potentially exhausted for other daily tasks.<br>
			Utopianism/The idea “building products for a dystopic future” (Hertz, G. n.d.) was a critical making method I used for the idea and making of my prototype. 
			I took the idea of utopic based racing and action kid’s games where you would race/run through a utopic city with the objective of winning and you’d have 
			powerups on certain paths, like hearts, to increase your health. The map would signal to users where these powerups are to help them win and I used this idea 
			in a more dystopic point of view: Designing for a future where users forget/aren’t used to the world around them. </p>

		<h1>Target Audience</h1>

		<p>The target audience for this project isn’t specified but could be aimed at people who run lots, on one hand, and people who walk for long 
		periods to different place regularly on, on the other hand. As said earlier though, this would really benefit anyone who doesn’t consider 
		this part of their daily lives and would love to take an interest as it would benefit their physical health.<br>
		This project is important as it could provide a huge benefit that people don’t even realize on a daily basis which consists of helping people 
		conserve energy on their daily fitness activities or even just a daily routine of walking to places. The reason why this is a big benefit is it can 
		leave you less tired and help you balance energy within several activities which you might have within the day and you aren’t using all your 
		energy for one purpose.<br>
		Therefore, for runners who use running as a main focus of their day, this app would help them to get the best out of their runs through helping them to last longer and run extended distances due 
		to healthy and consistent energy consumption and for others, who use running as a small part of their day (to enjoy), this app will help them to use their energy more considreably and sparingly
		so that they can leave themselves more energy for the important/other taks they will have during the day.</p>

			<h1>Positioning on taxonomy scale</h1>
			
			<p> My app would go in the area circled (between modified reality and augmented realtiy.) A said in the reading "      
				virtual information added to the user's view", this is exactly what my app does in the form of gamification where ive also taken the idea of modifying 
			virtuality if the world of kids action games to display on a real life view of a user. As also displayed in the reading, the Pokemon go game which is location-based
		and uses GPS to action on pokemons in whilst users navigate the real world, this is the same concept in my one as it uses location-based GPS to show you which paths to
	take to conserve energy which has been modified with a game play interface so you are still having a real life view but with a few gamilfied objects to spark mativation 
like the pokemon game. This is called monitor-based AR where through connectivity and GPS, your location is constantly tracked and displayed to you whilst the app purposely
overlays warning signals, your energy levels meter and the accompanying words to utilise this capability. </p>

		<h1>How it works</h1>

	Input<br>
	
	The input for my project will be the movements of users. So essentially how the system will be powered is by the movements of the person. The person almost acts as the input system where the tracking only starts when the person starts moving means the system will have something to track otheriwse a still person wont have anything use to the system  The energy level consumption meter will also only rise and fall with tracking of the body. The gps will also only move (like a car navigator) when the person startes moving. So for example, Someone on a run will consistently be inputting the measurements of their specific body movements for its software to process.
	<br><br>
	Process<br>
	
	How it will work is once someone starts running/walking, the system will use Mocap softwre to process the detection of your energy levels as a result of your porsture, water levels, etc and will also use these whilst using gps tracking software to dtetect the places in which to go to match your enegry levels, helping you to last longer. For example, running in a specific area like a mountain, your posture, speed, and water levels will be constantly read by the mocap coftware giving you the resposive figure feedback whilst also keeping the gps moving.
	<br><br>
	Output<br>
	
	Once this is done, instead of placing ar markers of some kind in areas of which to avoid and/or run/walk in, the signalling will b done through an alert/pulsing of the energy level consumptions meter.So basically for example, if the persons posture, water levels, and speed is good (consequently meaning his energy levels are good), the meter will just steady out/rise however if the energy levels are low, then the EC meter will pulse and this will also promote the use of exclamation marks which will pop up in areas which the person should avoid running to conserve energy.
